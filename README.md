## Code Information
### Architecture
We built our project with JavaScript and React.js. All React components can be found in the src/components directory (except for the root App.js component which is in the src directory). We named the components clearly and organized them into folders where it made sense.

- `src/components/Home.js`
- `src/components/FormLanding.js`
- `src/componenets/FormOne.js`
- `src/componenets/FormTwo.js`
- `src/components/FormThree.js`
- `src/components/EfficiencyDashboard.js`
- `src/componenets/Calculator.js`

### What air cleaners are being recommended?
Air cleaners being recommended are from the following API of air cleaners provided by Energy Star's certified list of room air cleaners. Link to the overall page is [here](https://www.energystar.gov/productfinder/product/certified-room-air-cleaners/results) and the link to the API is [here](https://dev.socrata.com/foundry/data.energystar.gov/jmck-i55n). This is of Energy Star certified...

### Running the application locally

You will need to have `npm` installed. You can install it [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/). Once npm is installed, you can run `npm install` in the project directory to install required dependencies for the project. Finally, run `npm start` to run the app. You will be able to view it at http://localhost:3000 in your browser.


### Running tests
Run `npm test -- fileName.test.js` to run a test file. The different test files conflict when being run so they need to be run individually and the code in the test files not currently being run needs to be commented. We used [react-testing-library](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/) to create our tests. The tests ensure any calculations we use work as expected and also user interaction like filtering/sorting works as expected.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
